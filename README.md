Starting in the Fall of 2020, I thought up the idea of a modular system for creating a portable go-box.  I wanted something where everything (minus power) was self-contained and except for attaching antennas, nothing needed to be setup.  I wanted it to be as simple as opening the box, connecting the antennas, power cable, and then being able to use it immediately.

The following skills were necessary to complete this project:
- Familiarity with CAD (although you may not need it since I will provide the files)
- Access to CAD software
- Familiarity with Linux
- Basic soldering

I do not own a 3D printer, if I had, this project would have been easier to build.  I decided to build the entire thing out of aluminum, but you can easily convert all of this to work with a 3D printer instead.  The cost may be cheaper to do so.  Also, if you have access to a CNC router, you do not need to send this out for laser cutting.

## My Requirements

I had simple requirements for the entire project:

1. Total cost of materials should be as inexpensive as possible.  Amateur radio is already an expensive hobby and building a box that you may not use that often should as inexpensive as possible.
2. As few specialty tools as possible needed.
3. No exceptional skills required such as welding.
4. Except for the power source and antennas, everything should fit within the enclosure.
5. Enclosure should be waterproof and as light as possible.
6. Controllable via a phone.
7. Three radios including an HF radio station.
